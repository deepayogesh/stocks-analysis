# Measure performance of the stock using Visual Basic for Applications
## Overview of Project
To invest in the green energy companies, I had to measure the stock’s performance in the year.
 
I analyzed daily opening prices, closing prices and volume of the stocks to find out which one had positive returns for a given year.
 
## Purpose
 
Goal of the project was to find out the performance and yearly return of the stock. If the stock is traded often, then the price will accurately reflect the value of the stock.
 
 
## Analysis and Challenges
 
Thousands of rows containing data of daily stock transactions used to find the yearly volume and return of a specific stock.
 
To find out how often stock is traded, I added daily volume of each stock for the chosen year. I also measured the performance of the stock for the years 2018 and 2017. Performance of the stock was calculated based on difference between the first closing price and last closing price of the stock for the year.
 
## Yearly Performance measured for stock
 
###1. Power of macros in Microsoft Excel made this job easy to find the performance of the stock.
Analysis indicates that in 2017 performance of all the stocks was positive except one as shown in this analyzed data.
 
It is very easy to spot the performance of the stocks with the color-coded data. Stocks with positive returns are shown in green color and the ones with negative returns are shown in red color.

###2. In the year 2018 only two companies had positive returns whereas most of the others didn’t have any positive return. We can observe this just by looking at stocks with red colors indicating negative return as shown in this analyzed data.
